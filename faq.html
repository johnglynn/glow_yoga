				<h3>How do I prepare for my first class?</h3>
					<p>Take a breath. You have just made a beautiful decision in your life. You are about to begin your first hot yoga class, Yay! Maybe you've been contemplating this for a while, maybe you’re being spontaneous. Either way, it's beautiful.<br>
					<br> 
					Now it's time to prepare for the first day of the rest of your life. Know that we have first timers everyday and that all of our classes are suitable for beginners.<br>
					<br> 
					You are in the best hands of genuine certified instructors who will compassionately guide you. How do you feel now? The first way to prepare is mentally.</p>

				<h3>What should I wear to practice?</h3>
					<p>OMG what do I wear?? Good question.  You will sweat, A LOT. Most importantly, wear what's comfortable for YOU.<br>
					<br> 
					From leggings to shorts, from tank tops to sport bras, wear what makes you feel good.  It's best not to wear cotton material, as it will cling to your body and may restrict movement. </p>

				<h3>What do I bring to class?</h3>
					<p>Simple. Yoga mat, large beach sized towel, bottled water (no glass bottles please). We have all of these items available for rent, so don't fret if you forget or just want to travel lite—we have you covered.<br>
					<br>  
					If you underestimate your water consumption during class (it happens), we will bring you a cold one from the fridge. Please, no leaving the room to refill your water bottle.</p>

				<h3>What should I eat before/after class?</h3>
					<p>Yoga is best practiced on an empty stomach.  Try not to eat 2-3 hours before class.  However, if you feel that you need extra fuel, it's best to keep it lite.<br>
					<br> 
					Most importantly, HYDRATE!!! Drink plenty of water starting more than an hour before class. After your practice, eat what feels right and don’t forget to HYDRATE!!!</p>

				<h3>Why do we practice in the heat?</h3>
					<p>Shocked? You’re not alone. The heat is extremely relevant to your practice. We are not here to torture you, the heat is a valuable element for the opening of your body.<br>
					<br> 
					Think of a piece of steel, we melt it before we bend it.  Same concept for your body. By heating the body first,  muscles and joints are able to move more freely with less resistance, therefore becoming less susceptible to injury.<br>
					<br>  
					More great news.. your sweat releases toxins! Amazing, we know, and (as we said) you will sweat A LOT!</p>

				<h3>How many time a week is it ok to practice?</h3>
					<p>#everydamnday!!!<br>
					<br>
					Caution: Your body might crave this practice. Yes, It's safe. The more you practice, the better! At least three classes per week is best.  If this is unrealistic, we understand. Every so often is better than nothing at all.</p>

				<h3>I feel nauseous and dizzy during class, is this normal?</h3>
					<p>Welcome to the club, you did great! Nausea and dizziness are common and temporary. These symptoms are normally signs of dehydration and/or lack of breath.<br>
					<br>	  
					Be sure to drink plenty of water before class and be conscious of your breathing during your practice. </p>	

				<h3>I'm very sore after my first class, is this normal?</h3>
					<p>Absolutely. You did it right. The best thing to do is practice the following day. Your muscles and joints will thank you.</p>
